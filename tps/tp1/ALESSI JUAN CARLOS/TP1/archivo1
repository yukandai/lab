Boca Juniors suffered one of their worst defeats as they crashed 6-1 at relegation candidates San Martin, while Independiente are searching for a new coach in a tumultuous round of Argentina's 'Final' championship.

The defeat in San Juan prompted Boca manager Carlos Bianchi to apologise and also concede their league aspirations were over. "To all Boca supporters I say sorry for this defeat they don't deserve," Bianchi wrote in an open letter to Boca fans on Saturday. "The team and I are ashamed at how we were beaten because this kind of result not only hurts but forces us to rethink many things.

"From now we'll focus our efforts on the Libertadores Cup." San Martin had gone 16 matches without a victory, while six times South American champions Boca have only one win and eight points after nine matches. Colombian striker Humberto Osorio, wearing an eye guard that looks like a Lone Ranger mask, put the home side ahead in the second minute and went on to complete a hat-trick with a diving header and a low shot into the bottom corner from a tight angle.

Boca pulled a goal back when 2-0 down with a penalty converted by Uruguayan striker Santiago Silva but hardly had time to dream of a recovery as Landa scored San Martin's third with a fine header into the top corner two minutes later. The defeat was hardly the best way for Boca to celebrate a century of uninterrupted first division soccer since their top flight debut on April 13, 1913.

It was Boca's worst defeat since they lost 7-2 at Rosario Central in 2003. The last time Boca were beaten 6-1 in the league was by another San Martin, from Tucuman, in 1988 and they lost 6-0 to Gimnasia La Plata in 1996.
